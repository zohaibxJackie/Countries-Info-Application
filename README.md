## My process

### Built with

- Html 5
- Tailwind
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
By doing this project, I was able to understand props in more detail. Furthermore, I learned about REST APIs. I was an excellent journey to learn about React in more detail.

### Continued development

Although, I have learned a lot from this project but there are still many areas where I need improvements especially using the context api and passing props. I will try to implement these things in my future prjects.
